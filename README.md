Rock spectral data are preprocessed with SG smoothing to remove noise, then downscaled by PCA to get features. A Bayesian-optimized lithology identification model is established based on these features, with hyperparameters optimized by BO algorithm to avoid local optima and output the predicted rock type. Also, a comparison between ANN and RF models is done, using GAO algorithm for comparison and analyzing their identification results on PCA-reduced data.
Firstly, PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality of the preprocessed rock spectral data, which reduced the redundancy of the rock spectral data, optimized the effective identification information, and solved the problem of overfitting caused by the high dimensionality of the rock spectral data. Using ANN to establish a machine learning model for rock spectral data, optimizing hyperparameters through a probabilistic model-based BO algorithm, avoiding getting stuck in local optima, and improving the recognition performance of the intelligent lithology recognition model. Finally, the method and model were validated using a self-made dataset, achieving rapid and intelligent recognition of lithology.
