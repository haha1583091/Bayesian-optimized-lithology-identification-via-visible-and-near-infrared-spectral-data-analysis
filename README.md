Rock spectral data are preprocessed with SG smoothing to remove noise, then downscaled by PCA to get features. A Bayesian-optimized lithology identification model is established based on these features, with hyperparameters optimized by BO algorithm to avoid local optima and output the predicted rock type. Also, a comparison between ANN and RF models is done, using GAO algorithm for comparison and analyzing their identification results on PCA-reduced data.
